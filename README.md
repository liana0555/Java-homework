============

## Rules
- The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.
- The deck is divided evenly and randomly among the players, giving
each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of
their deck -this is a "battle"- and the player with the higher card takes
both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are
high, and suits are ignored.
- If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both
players place the next 2 cards from their pile face down and then
another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the
war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If
the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another
set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up
card is higher than their opponent's.
- If a player runs out of cards during a war, that player immediately
loses. In others, the player may play the last card in their deck as
their face-up card for the remainder of the war or replay the game
from the beginning.
- The game will continue until one player has collected all of the cards.
